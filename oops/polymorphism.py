### Polymorphosm ###
'''
Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use common interface for multiple form (data types).

Suppose, we need to color a shape, there are multiple shape option (rectangle, square, circle). 
However we could use same method to color any shape. This concept is called Polymorphism.

class Parrot:

    def fly(self):
        print("Parrot can fly")
    
    def swim(self):
        print("Parrot can't swim")

class Penguin:

    def fly(self):
        print("Penguin can't fly")
    
    def swim(self):
        print("Penguin can swim")

# common interface
def flying_test(bird):
    bird.fly()

#instantiate objects
blu = Parrot()
peggy = Penguin()

# passing the object
flying_test(blu)
flying_test(peggy)

# Output
# Parrot can fly
# Penguin can't fly
