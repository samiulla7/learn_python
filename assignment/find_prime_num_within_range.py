'''Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
Note: A Prime Number is a whole number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers

Examples:

6 is not a Prime Number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
37 is a Prime Number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
Given:

start = 25
end = 50
Expected output:

Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37
41
43
47'''
start = 25
end = 50
print("Prime numbers between", start, "and", end, "are:")

for num in range(start, end + 1):
    # all prime numbers are greater than 1
    # if number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime
    if num > 1:
        for i in range(2, num):
            # check for factors
            if (num % i) == 0:
                # not a prime number so break inner loop and
                # look for next number
                break
        else:
            print(num)
